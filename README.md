# Hey there, I'm Prasiddha Shah! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Austin, Texas, with a passion for building cool stuff! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸš€ Currently, I'm immersed in the exciting world of web development, working on a sleek and user-friendly website for a food business in Austin.  
ðŸ“š I'm also diving deep into Docker and Google Cloud Platform to level up my skills and explore the endless possibilities of cloud-based projects.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite full-stack frameworks and how I leverage them in my projects!  
ðŸ“« Let's connect! Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasiddhashah/) and let's chat about new favorite tech innovations.  
âš½ Fun fact: When I'm not coding or exploring the cloud, you can find me on the soccer field, playing Sunday league soccer and enjoying the beautiful game!
